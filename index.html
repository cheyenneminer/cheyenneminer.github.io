	<p> I am currently a student in the School of Journalism and Communications at the University of Oregon, pursuing a degree in Journalism with minors in both Women's and Gender Studies and Multimedia Design. I spend a lot of my time at my part time barista/manager job at Full City Coffee Roasters in Eugene. </p>
	<p>Being involved in activities on campus and in the surrounding community is important to me. I am a member of a student group called UO Hack. UO Hack is a computer programming group focusing on HTML and CSS coding. I am also on staff at Oregon Voice, a student run publication that publishes student writing and art. Currently, I am a volunteer for SafeRide at University of Oregon through the Women's Center. 
	<p>In addition to my strong journalism and multimedia background, I am versed in multiple areas of science including; Chemistry and Biology. I have completed about one third of a Human Physiology degree. </p>
	<p> English is my primary spoken language, but I have studied both Chinese and Spanish.
	<p> I am interested in the sharing of information across multiple platforms, photojournalism, graphic design, and all things epic in the field of journalism.
