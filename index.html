  <p> If I were an animal I would be a scavenger. You could find me ravaging the racks of clothes at your local thrift store. I am hunting for an elusive, unique beast. I have been thrifting for the majority of my life, but it wasnâ€™t until recently that I discovered the pile of gold that I had been sitting on. I shop for myself, of course, but I also look for things that are valuable in hopes to finance my habit. It is something that I enjoy doing and do often. </P><p>
I have spent the past four years in a semi-charmed sort of place called the University of Oregon where I have managed to polish my story telling skills. I use pictures, video, and audio to paint a complete and powerful picture for the consumer.  I currently paint these pictures for a student run publication called the Oregon Voice as a feature writer and budget wine reviewer. In my off time I dabble in marketing farm and acreage real estate. I have also played club soccer at the University of Oregon, and joined the fight against violence of all kinds by volunteering at Safe Ride UO. I am a self-proclaimed expert at social media, and have helped multiple companies including Friends of Buford and Mt. Pisgah and Eugene Timbers Futbol Club launch and maintain successful social media campaigns. </p><p>
I enjoy all kinds of writing, but my favorite is long-form feature writing. Fiction, however, is nipping at its heels. I like to write because words are immortal. When we leave this earth the things that we wrote down will remain, living on as the truest testament to who we were. I am rarely without a pen in my hand.
