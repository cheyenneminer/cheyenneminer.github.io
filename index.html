	<p> I am currently a student in the School of Journalism and Communications at the University of Oregon, pursuing a degree in Journalism with minors in both Women's and Gender Studies and Multimedia Design. When I am not in class, I am working as a barista/standing manager at Full City Coffee Roasters in Eugene. </p>
	<p>Being involved in activities on campus and in the surrounding community is important to me. The more involved I am, the happier I tend to be. I am a member of a student group called UO Hack. UO Hack is a computer programming group focusing on HTML and CSS coding. I am also on staff at Oregon Voice, a completely student run publication for student writing and art. My intrest in Women's and Gender Studies led me to a volunteer opportunity with Safe Ride at University of Oregon Women's Center. Safe Ride is a group of staff and volunteers dedicated to preventing assualts on students. In addition, I have used my passion for yoga to further my community involvement. After I graduated from Junction City High School I was a volunteer yoga instructor for the women's soccer team. This same passion inspired me to start my blog; Let's Get Twisted, to share my yoga experiences with the internet community. 
	</p>
	<p>In addition to my strong journalism and multimedia background, I am versed in multiple areas of science including; Chemistry and Biology. I have completed about one third of a Human Physiology degree. </p>
	<p> English is my primary spoken language, but I have studied both Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.
	<p> I am interested in the sharing of information across multiple platforms, photojournalism, graphic design, computer programming, multimedia and all things epic in the field of journalism.
